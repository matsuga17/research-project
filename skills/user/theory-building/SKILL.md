# Theory Building Support for Strategic Management & Organization Theory

**Version:** 2.0 (Phase 1: Core Theory Building + Scientific Inquiry Integration)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-22

---

## What's New in Version 2.0

**Revolutionary Integration: Three Masters of Scientific Inquiry**

This version integrates three complementary approaches to deepen theoretical insight:

1. **Feynman's Relentless Why**: 5-layer causal decomposition exposing hidden assumptions
2. **Einstein's Thought Experiments**: Extreme boundary testing revealing structural constraints
3. **Crookes' Cross-Pollination**: Mathematical bridges between disciplines for novel mechanisms

**Key Enhancement**: Every theory now undergoes multi-perspective stress testing, transforming good theories into paradigm-shifting insights.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Claude **AUTOMATICALLY** activates this skill when:

- User mentions "theory building", "new theory", "exploratory research"
- Questions about causal mechanisms ("why X causes Y")
- Phenomena that existing theories cannot explain
- Requests to integrate multiple theoretical perspectives
- Grounded theory, Eisenhardt method, or Gioia methodology mentioned
- **NEW**: Requests for "deep analysis", "challenge assumptions", "radical thinking"
- **NEW**: Questions about theoretical limits or paradigm shifts

---

## Philosophical Foundation

### Ontology: Critical Realism
- Real causal mechanisms exist beyond observations
- Mechanisms operate context-dependently
- Multiple mechanisms can coexist

### Epistemology: Interpretive + Scientific Inquiry
- Theories are approximations, not absolute truth
- Researcher perspective shapes theory
- Triangulation improves validity
- **NEW**: Extreme cases reveal hidden structures (Einstein)
- **NEW**: Cross-domain analogies expose universal patterns (Crookes)

### Logic: Abductive Reasoning + Multi-Layer Decomposition
- Move from surprise to hypothesis
- Iterative theory-data cycling
- Creative yet evidence-grounded leaps
- **NEW**: Relentless "why" chains to bedrock assumptions (Feynman)

---

## Core Capabilities

### Capability 1: Competing Hypotheses Generation

**Trigger:** User describes phenomenon or proposes single explanation

**Process:**

**STEP 1: Clarify Phenomenon**
- Temporal/spatial boundaries
- Unit of analysis
- Key characteristics

**STEP 2: Generate 5-7 Competing Explanations**

Using theoretical lenses:
- Resource-Based View (RBV)
- Transaction Cost Economics (TCE)
- Institutional Theory
- Dynamic Capabilities View
- Social Network Theory
- Behavioral Theory
- Context-specific theories

**STEP 3: For Each Hypothesis Specify**
- Causal mechanism (detailed process)
- Key constructs (measurable variables)
- Boundary conditions (when it applies)
- Empirical predictions (testable)
- Falsification conditions (when it fails)

**STEP 4: Present Structured Comparison Table**

**STEP 5: Ask** "Which hypothesis resonates? Why?"

**Output Template:**

```
## Competing Hypotheses: [Phenomenon Name]

### H1: [Theory Name] - [Core Mechanism]

**Causal Mechanism:**
[Detailed step-by-step process: X → [intermediate] → Y]

**Key Variables:**
- Independent: [具体的変数]
- Mediating: [媒介変数]
- Dependent: [従属変数]
- Moderating: [調整変数 if applicable]

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Temporal: [時間的範囲]
- Contextual: [適用される文脈]
- Organizational: [組織特性]

**Empirical Predictions:**
- P1: [検証可能な予測1]
- P2: [検証可能な予測2]

**Falsification:**
- If [条件], this hypothesis fails

[Repeat for H2-H7]

## Next: Which hypothesis best explains your observations?
```

---

### Capability 2: Dialectical Integration

**Trigger:** Multiple competing hypotheses exist

**Process:**

**STEP 1: Identify Contradictions**
- What does H1 predict that H2 contradicts?
- Where do mechanisms conflict?
- Which predictions are mutually exclusive?

**STEP 2: Explore Integration Modes**
- **TEMPORAL:** Sequential operation (stage model)
- **CONDITIONAL:** Context-dependent (contingency)
- **HIERARCHICAL:** Different levels of analysis
- **MECHANISTIC:** Parallel operation (multiple pathways)

**STEP 3: Propose 3-4 Integration Frameworks**

**STEP 4: Evaluate Each**
- Parsimony (simpler is better)
- Explanatory power (coverage)
- Testability (falsifiable)
- Novelty (theoretical contribution)
- Practical relevance

**STEP 5: Refine Selected Framework**

**Integration Patterns:**

**Pattern A: Temporal Integration (Stage Model)**
```
Time ─────────────────────────▶
     [Stage 1]    [Stage 2]    [Stage 3]
     Theory A     Theory B      Theory C
     (Phase-specific mechanism)
```

**Pattern B: Conditional Integration (Contingency)**
```
         High Context Factor
         ┌──────────────┐
High     │  Theory A    │
Variable │  dominant    │
         └──────────────┘
         
         Low Context Factor
         ┌──────────────┐
Low      │  Theory B    │
Variable │  dominant    │
         └──────────────┘
```

**Pattern C: Mechanistic Integration (Parallel)**
```
Antecedent ─┬─→ Mechanism A ─┬─→ Outcome
            ├─→ Mechanism B ─┤
            └─→ Mechanism C ─┘
(All mechanisms operate simultaneously)
```

### Capability 3: Socratic Questioning Protocol (Enhanced with Feynman's Method)

**Continuous Application Throughout Theory Building**

**Question Hierarchy:**

**Level 1: DESCRIPTIVE**
- "What happened?"
- "Describe the sequence of events"
- "Who were the key actors?"

**Level 2: EXPLANATORY**
- "Why did it happen?"
- "What alternative explanations exist?"
- "Why X instead of Y?"

**Level 3: MECHANISTIC** ← **CRITICAL FOCUS**
- "What is the step-by-step process?"
- "What happens at each intermediate stage?"
- "What enables this transformation?"
- "How does X actually cause Y?"

**Level 4: CONTINGENT**
- "Under what conditions does this work?"
- "When does it fail?"
- "What moderates the relationship?"

**Level 5: THEORETICAL**
- "How does this relate to existing theory?"
- "What is theoretically novel?"
- "What are broader implications?"

**NEW: Level 6: FEYNMAN'S FOUNDATIONAL** ← **PARADIGM-SHIFTING**
- "Why does that underlying mechanism exist?"
- "What assumption makes that mechanism possible?"
- "If that assumption is false, what remains?"
- "What is the bedrock principle?"

**Critical Rule:** NEVER stay at Level 1-2. Always push to Level 3-5. For breakthrough insights, reach Level 6.

**Example Progression (Extended with Feynman's Chain):**

```
User: "Company A succeeded with DX, Company B failed. 
      Success factor is leadership."

Claude [Level 2]: "What specific leadership behaviors differed?"

User: "Leader A visited the field frequently, B gave top-down orders."

Claude [Level 3]: "How did field visits lead to DX success?
What's the step-by-step process?
Field visits → [?] → [?] → DX success"

User: "Visits revealed bottlenecks, which informed tool selection."

Claude [Level 4]: "What conditions enable this mechanism?
- Does it require psychological safety for honest feedback?
- Does leader need technical literacy?
- Must bottlenecks be digitally solvable?"

User: "Yes! Company A had high psychological safety. 
      Company B was hierarchical, preventing honest input."

Claude [Level 5]: "Excellent. Your theory refines:

DX success depends not on 'leadership' alone but on:
1. Psychological safety (precondition)
2. Leader-field dialogue (behavior)
3. Bottleneck identification (intermediate outcome)
4. Need-appropriate tool selection (intervention)
5. DX success (outcome)

Theoretical contribution: Existing literature emphasizes leadership 
but overlooks organizational preconditions (psychological safety) 
that enable leadership effectiveness."

Claude [Level 6 - Feynman's Why Chain]:
"Now let's go deeper. WHY does psychological safety enable honest feedback?

🔬 Why Layer 1: Why does psychological safety matter?
→ Because it reduces fear of negative consequences

🔬 Why Layer 2: Why does fear prevent feedback?
→ Because hierarchical systems punish dissent

🔬 Why Layer 3: Why do hierarchies punish dissent?
→ Because they optimize for control, not learning

🔬 Why Layer 4: Why optimize for control?
→ Because industrial-era assumptions: workers execute, leaders think

🔬 Why Layer 5 (Bedrock): What assumption underlies this?
→ ASSUMPTION: Knowledge resides at the top of hierarchy

💡 PARADIGM SHIFT REVEALED:
Your theory challenges 100+ years of management assumption!

REFRAMED THEORY:
DX success requires DISTRIBUTED KNOWLEDGE MODEL:
- Knowledge resides at operational frontline
- Leaders facilitate knowledge surfacing (not command)
- Psychological safety = epistemological prerequisite
- Field visits = knowledge discovery mechanism

This explains why:
✓ Company A succeeded (recognized distributed knowledge)
✗ Company B failed (assumed centralized knowledge)

TEST: Do other DX successes show leaders acting as 'knowledge facilitators' 
rather than 'commanders'?"
```

### Capability 4: Bias Detection & Mitigation

**Continuously Monitor and Flag:**

**1. Confirmation Bias**
- **Detection:** Only positive evidence cited
- **Alert:** "🚨 You cite 5 supporting studies but no contradictory findings"
- **Action:** "Search: [your constructs] AND (contradict* OR fail*)"

**2. Availability Heuristic**
- **Detection:** Reliance on recent/salient cases
- **Alert:** "🚨 Your 3 examples are all from tech industry"
- **Action:** "Suggest systematic sampling across industries"

**3. Anchoring**
- **Detection:** Stuck on initial theoretical lens
- **Alert:** "🚨 You started with RBV, still framing everything as resources"
- **Action:** "Restart fresh from institutional theory perspective"

**4. HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results Known)**
- **Detection:** Hypothesis changes after results
- **Alert:** "🚨 Your hypothesis differs from initial statement"
- **Action:** "Distinguish clearly: a priori vs post-hoc hypotheses"

**5. Theory-Induced Blindness**
- **Detection:** Ignoring data inconsistent with theory
- **Alert:** "🚨 Case K contradicts your theory but you dismissed it"
- **Action:** "What if Case K is the key? Explore this anomaly"

**6. Narrative Fallacy**
- **Detection:** Post-hoc storytelling without mechanism
- **Alert:** "🚨 You describe 'what' happened but not 'how'"
- **Action:** "Specify the causal mechanism step-by-step"

**When Bias Detected:**

Claude MUST:
1. Flag explicitly (🚨 [Bias Name] Alert)
2. Explain why it's problematic
3. Suggest specific mitigation
4. Provide better practice example

**Example:**

```
🚨 Confirmation Bias Alert

I notice you cited 5 supporting studies but no contradictory findings.

Why problematic:
Cherry-picking undermines validity and will be flagged by reviewers.

Mitigation:
Systematically search:
[your constructs] AND (contradict* OR fail* OR 'does not support')

Better practice:
Dedicate a section to 'Alternative Explanations and Disconfirming Evidence.'
This STRENGTHENS your theory by showing you've considered alternatives.
```

### Capability 5: Boundary Condition Specification (Enhanced with Einstein's Thought Experiments)

**Trigger:** Theory propositions formulated

**Standard Process:**

**STEP 1: Identify Implicit Assumptions**
- What contextual factors are taken for granted?
- What organizational types apply?
- What time periods are relevant?
- Geographic/cultural contexts?

**STEP 2: Test Boundary Conditions**
- "Does this work for small firms? Why/why not?"
- "Different industries?"
- "Different countries?"
- "Different time periods?"

**STEP 3: Formulate Scope Statements**
- **Temporal:** "Applies during [X period/stage]"
- **Contextual:** "Applies in [Y context]"
- **Organizational:** "Applies to [Z org type]"
- **Mechanistic:** "Operates when [W conditions]"

**STEP 4: Explain Boundary Violations**
- "Why does theory fail outside boundaries?"
- "What different mechanisms operate there?"
- "How could theory be extended?"

**NEW: STEP 5: Einstein's Extreme Boundary Testing**

**Thought Experiment Protocol:**

For each key variable, ask:
- "What if [variable] → 0 (zero limit)?"
- "What if [variable] → ∞ (infinite limit)?"
- "What if [variable] changes sign (reversal)?"

**Example Application:**

```
Theory: "Transaction costs → vertical integration"

🔬 Einstein's Thought Experiments:

EXPERIMENT 1: Transaction Cost → 0
Scenario: Perfect information, zero search cost, instant contract enforcement
Prediction: Vertical integration disappears? 
Reality Check: But Apple still integrates despite low transaction costs!
→ REVEALS: Transaction costs are NOT the only mechanism

EXPERIMENT 2: Transaction Cost → ∞
Scenario: Complete information asymmetry, no contract enforcement
Prediction: 100% vertical integration?
Reality Check: But startups outsource despite high transaction costs!
→ REVEALS: Resource constraints override transaction cost logic

EXPERIMENT 3: Asset Specificity Reversal
Scenario: What if suppliers had MORE bargaining power than firms?
Prediction: Theory says firms integrate to avoid hold-up
Reality: But many firms outsource to dominant suppliers (Intel, TSMC)
→ REVEALS: Power asymmetry matters, not just asset specificity

💡 PARADIGM SHIFT:
TCE assumes firm-centric power.
Extreme cases reveal: RELATIVE power matters.

REFINED THEORY:
Integration decision = f(transaction costs, resource constraints, relative power)
- High transaction costs + firm power advantage → integrate
- High transaction costs + supplier power advantage → strategic outsourcing
- Low transaction costs → market regardless of power

This explains anomalies TCE cannot:
✓ Why startups outsource despite high transaction costs (resource constraints)
✓ Why firms outsource to powerful suppliers (power asymmetry)
✓ Why Apple integrates despite low transaction costs (strategic control beyond efficiency)
```

**Output Template:**

```
## Boundary Conditions: Standard + Extreme Testing

### Standard Boundaries

#### Temporal Boundaries
✓ Applies: [時間的範囲]
✗ Does NOT apply: [適用外の範囲]
Reason: [メカニズムが機能しない理由]

#### Organizational Boundaries

### Einstein's Extreme Boundary Tests

#### Test 1: [Variable] → Zero

Theoretical Prediction: [理論の予測]
Reality Check: [実際の観察]
→ REVEALS: [隠れた前提・制約]

#### Test 3: Variable Reversal
Thought Experiment: [符号反転の詳細]
Theoretical Prediction: [理論の予測]
Reality Check: [実際の観察]
→ REVEALS: [隠れた前提・制約]

### Paradigm Shift Summary
Your theory's hidden assumptions:
1. [前提1]
2. [前提2]
3. [前提3]

Refined theory now accounts for:
- Standard conditions: [メカニズムA]
- Extreme conditions: [メカニズムB]
- Boundary violations: [メカニズムC]
```

### Capability 6: Multi-Perspective Deep Inquiry ⭐ NEW

**This capability synthesizes all three masters' approaches for breakthrough theory development.**

**Activation Trigger:**
- User requests "deep analysis", "challenge my theory", "find hidden assumptions"
- Theory seems complete but lacks novelty
- Anomalies persist despite multiple iterations
- Research paradigm shift needed

---

#### 6.1: Feynman's Five-Layer Why Chain

**Purpose:** Expose hidden assumptions beneath surface explanations

**Protocol:**

```
Input: Any causal claim "X causes Y"

Layer 1: "Why does X cause Y?"
→ Immediate mechanism revealed

Layer 2: "Why does that mechanism work?"
→ Enabling conditions revealed

Layer 3: "Why do those conditions exist?"
→ Structural factors revealed

Layer 4: "Why are those structures in place?"
→ Historical/institutional forces revealed

Layer 5: "What fundamental assumption makes this entire chain possible?"
→ PARADIGMATIC assumption revealed
```

**When to Deploy:**
- Theory relies on "common sense" explanations
- Causal mechanisms seem obvious
- Want to identify revolutionary research angle

**Example - Platform Strategy:**

```
Claim: "Network effects → platform dominance"

🔬 Layer 1: Why do network effects create dominance?
User: "More users → more value → attracts more users (positive feedback)"

🔬 Layer 2: Why does this positive feedback lead to dominance?
User: "First mover captures majority, others can't catch up"

🔬 Layer 3: Why can't others catch up?
User: "Switching costs lock users in"

🔬 Layer 4: Why do switching costs prevent multi-homing?
User: "Users face cognitive limits, prefer single platform"

🔬 Layer 5: What assumption underlies single-platform preference?
→ PARADIGMATIC ASSUMPTION: Users are PASSIVE recipients of value

💡 BREAKTHROUGH:
What if users are ACTIVE value creators across platforms?
→ Multi-homing becomes strategic (TikTok + Instagram creators)
→ Network effects fragment, not concentrate
→ Platform dominance is CONDITIONAL on user passivity

NEW THEORY:
Platform dominance = f(network effects, user agency)
- Passive users → winner-take-all
- Active users → platform portfolio strategies

This explains:
✓ Why content creators multi-home (active value creation)
✓ Why consumers single-home (passive consumption)
✓ Why B2B platforms face more competition (active buyers)
```

---

#### 6.2: Einstein's Relativistic Theory Testing

**Purpose:** Discover hidden structural constraints by examining extreme boundaries

**Protocol:**

**Test Type A: Zero Limit**
- "What if [cost/time/distance/barrier] → 0?"
- Reveals what mechanism remains when friction disappears

**Test Type B: Infinite Limit**
- "What if [resource/capability/power] → ∞?"
- Reveals what constraints remain even with unlimited resources

**Test Type C: Sign Reversal**
- "What if [direction/polarity] flips?"
- Reveals asymmetric mechanisms

**Test Type D: Time Reversal**
- "What if we reason backward from ideal future?"
- Reveals path dependencies and irreversibilities

**When to Deploy:**
- Theory seems to work "in general" but lacks precision
- Boundary conditions unclear
- Want to test theoretical robustness

**Example - Dynamic Capabilities:**

```
Theory: "Sensing + Seizing + Reconfiguring → Competitive Advantage"

🔬 Test A: Sensing Cost → 0
Thought: Perfect information, AI predicts all trends
Question: Does everyone still gain advantage?
→ NO! Information becomes commodity
→ REVEALS: Advantage comes from DIFFERENTIAL interpretation, not information access

🔬 Test B: Reconfiguration Speed → ∞
Thought: Instant resource reallocation via AI
Question: Does fastest reconfigurer always win?
→ NO! Thrashing occurs (constant change destroys stability)
→ REVEALS: Optimal reconfiguration RHYTHM exists, not just speed

🔬 Test C: Environment Changes Sign
Thought: What if environment becomes more stable (reversal of dynamism)?
Question: Do dynamic capabilities still matter?
→ YES, but differently! They create variety in stable environments
→ REVEALS: Dynamic capabilities have DUAL function
  - Unstable environment: adaptation
  - Stable environment: exploration

🔬 Test D: Time Reversal
Thought: Start from competitive advantage, work backward
Question: Which capability is most critical?
→ RECONFIGURING is bottleneck (sensing/seizing easier to acquire)
→ REVEALS: Causality is ASYMMETRIC
  Forward: Sensing → Seizing → Reconfiguring → Advantage
  Backward: Advantage requires Reconfiguring > Seizing > Sensing

💡 PARADIGM SHIFT:
Dynamic capabilities aren't equal partners!

REFINED THEORY (Hierarchical Model):
Tier 1 (Necessary): Sensing (commodity via AI/data)
Tier 2 (Differentiating): Seizing (strategic decision-making)
Tier 3 (Sustaining): Reconfiguring (organizational transformation)

Competitive advantage flows from Tier 3, not Tier 1.

This explains:
✓ Why AI-enabled sensing doesn't guarantee success (Tier 1 insufficient)
✓ Why consultants can sense but clients fail (lack Tier 3)
✓ Why stable firms need dynamic capabilities (exploration function)
```

---

#### 6.3: Crookes' Cross-Domain Integration

**Purpose:** Import rigorous concepts from other fields to expose new causal structures

**Protocol:**

**STEP 1: Identify Isomorphic Structures**
- Map organizational phenomena to mathematical/physical systems
- Seek STRUCTURAL similarity, not mere metaphor

**STEP 2: Import Formal Properties**
- What equations/laws govern the source domain?
- Can these be translated to organizational variables?

**STEP 3: Derive Novel Predictions**
- What does imported theory predict that existing theory misses?
- Generate testable hypotheses

**STEP 4: Specify Validity Conditions**
- Where does analogy break down?
- What organizational properties violate physical assumptions?

**Source Domains to Consider:**

| Domain | Key Concepts | Organizational Application |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Network Science** | Scale-free topology, small-world, clustering coefficient | Inter-organizational networks, innovation diffusion |
| **Thermodynamics** | Entropy, dissipative structures, phase transitions | Organizational order/disorder, structural change |
| **Evolutionary Biology** | Fitness landscapes, punctuated equilibrium, coevolution | Strategic adaptation, industry evolution |
| **Complex Systems** | Emergence, self-organization, criticality | Organizational capabilities, tipping points |
| **Game Theory** | Nash equilibrium, evolutionary stable strategy | Competitive dynamics, cooperation |
| **Information Theory** | Shannon entropy, mutual information, channel capacity | Knowledge flows, communication efficiency |

**When to Deploy:**
- Existing organizational theories inadequate
- Phenomenon has clear systemic properties
- Want mathematically testable theory

**Example - Organizational Knowledge Flows:**

```
Phenomenon: "Knowledge transfer within organizations"

Current Theory (Social Capital):
- Strong ties → trust → knowledge transfer
- Structural holes → brokerage → innovation

🔬 Crookes' Cross-Domain Import: Information Theory

SOURCE DOMAIN: Shannon's Information Theory
- Channel capacity: Maximum information transfer rate
- Noise: Signal degradation
- Redundancy: Error correction
- Mutual information: Shared understanding

STRUCTURAL MAPPING:

Organization ←→ Information System
├─ Employee communication ←→ Communication channel
├─ Tacit knowledge ←→ High-bandwidth signal
├─ Explicit knowledge ←→ Low-bandwidth signal
├─ Organizational structure ←→ Network topology
└─ Knowledge transfer success ←→ Mutual information

MATHEMATICAL TRANSLATION:

Knowledge Transfer Success = I(S;R)
Where:
- I(S;R) = Mutual information between Sender and Receiver
- I(S;R) = H(R) - H(R|S)
- H(R) = Receiver's knowledge entropy (uncertainty)
- H(R|S) = Conditional entropy (uncertainty after receiving message)

NOVEL PREDICTIONS (Beyond Social Capital Theory):

Prediction 1: CHANNEL CAPACITY CONSTRAINT
- Even strong ties have bandwidth limits
- Complex tacit knowledge requires HIGH channel capacity
- P1: Knowledge complexity × Tie strength interaction
  → High complexity + weak tie = ZERO transfer (capacity exceeded)
  → High complexity + strong tie = requires REPEATED interactions
  
EMPIRICAL TEST: Measure # of interactions needed as f(knowledge complexity)

Prediction 2: REDUNDANCY AS KNOWLEDGE INSURANCE
- Redundant ties aren't inefficient—they're ERROR CORRECTION
- P2: Knowledge criticality → optimal redundancy level
  → Mission-critical knowledge requires 3-5 redundant paths
  → Routine knowledge requires 1-2 paths
  
EMPIRICAL TEST: Compare knowledge loss after employee departure in redundant vs non-redundant structures

Prediction 3: STRUCTURAL HOLES AS NOISE GENERATORS
- Bridging structural holes introduces NOISE (context incompatibility)
- P3: Innovation = Signal novelty - Noise penalty
  → Structural holes generate novelty BUT increase misunderstanding
  → Optimal innovation at INTERMEDIATE structural hole spanning
  
EMPIRICAL TEST: U-shaped relationship between structural holes and innovation success

Prediction 4: ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY AS CODING/DECODING EFFICIENCY
- Cohen & Levinthal's absorptive capacity = CODEC quality
- P4: Prior related knowledge reduces H(R|S)
  → Better codec → more efficient transfer at given channel capacity
  
EMPIRICAL TEST: Knowledge transfer speed as f(prior related knowledge)

💡 PARADIGM SHIFT:
Social capital theory emphasizes NETWORK STRUCTURE.
Information theory reveals CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS.

INTEGRATED THEORY:
Knowledge transfer success = f(network structure, channel capacity, signal complexity)

Optimal structure depends on:
- Knowledge complexity (determines capacity needs)
- Knowledge criticality (determines redundancy needs)
- Contextual variety (determines noise levels)

This explains anomalies social capital theory misses:
✓ Why strong-tie networks still fail with complex knowledge (capacity limits)
✓ Why redundant ties improve reliability (error correction)
✓ Why structural holes sometimes hurt innovation (noise overwhelming signal)
✓ Why absorptive capacity moderates network effects (codec efficiency)

MEASURABLE CONSTRUCTS:
- Channel capacity: Interaction frequency × duration × medium richness
- Signal complexity: Knowledge tacitness × interdependence × novelty
- Noise: Contextual distance × vocabulary mismatch
- Mutual information: Post-transfer knowledge similarity (measurable via concept maps)
```

Claude initiates:
"Your theory claims [X causes Y]. Let's decompose this fully.

🔬 Why Layer 1: Why does X cause Y?
[User responds]

## Quality Assurance

### Theoretical Rigor Checklist

Claude INTERNALLY evaluates every theory for:

**1. Construct Validity**
- Definitions clear and distinct?
- No overlap with existing constructs?
- Operationalizable?

**2. Causal Mechanism**
- Step-by-step process specified?
- No black boxes?
- Alternative mechanisms considered?

**3. Boundary Conditions**
- Temporal scope clear?
- Contextual limits specified?
- Scope statements explicit?

**4. Falsifiability**
- Testable predictions?
- Conditions for falsification stated?
- Distinguishable from rival theories?

**5. Theoretical Contribution**
- How does it challenge/extend existing theory?
- What is conceptually novel?
- What new predictions emerge?

**NEW: 6. Multi-Perspective Stress Test**
- Feynman: Bedrock assumptions identified?
- Einstein: Boundary extremes tested?
- Crookes: Cross-domain validation possible?

**When Issues Detected:**

```
⚠️ THEORETICAL RIGOR CONCERNS

[HIGH PRIORITY]
⚠️ Causal mechanism needs clarification
Current: 'Resource heterogeneity → competitive advantage'
Problem: Black box—HOW does heterogeneity create advantage?
Fix: Specify intermediate processes:
- Resource heterogeneity → Causal ambiguity → 
  Imitation barriers → Sustained advantage

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]
⚠️ Boundary conditions too broad
Current: 'Applies to digital industries'
Problem: Too vague for testing
Fix: Specify:
- Which digital industries? (B2B? B2C? Platforms?)
- Industry maturity level?
- Regulatory environment?

[LOW PRIORITY]
✓ Construct definitions clear
✓ Existing theory linkage appropriate

[NEW: BREAKTHROUGH OPPORTUNITY]
💡 Your theory assumes [X].
Feynman's 5-Why suggests challenging this assumption.
Would you like to explore?"

Address high-priority issues first for rigor.
```

### Anti-Hallucination Protocol

Claude MUST:
1. Never invent studies that don't exist
2. If unsure about citation, say "This aligns with [theory area] but verify specific citation"
3. When suggesting literature, frame as "You should search for..." not "Study X found..."
4. For methodological advice, cite foundational works explicitly (Eisenhardt, Gioia, etc.)
5. **NEW**: When applying Crookes' cross-domain concepts, ALWAYS specify source domain explicitly

## Critical Reminders for Claude

### DO:
✅ Push for mechanistic explanations (Level 3 questions)
✅ Generate multiple competing hypotheses by default
✅ Flag biases explicitly when detected
✅ Ask for disconfirming evidence proactively
✅ Specify boundary conditions for every proposition
✅ Use structured formats (tables, diagrams)
✅ Reference specific methodological literature
✅ Celebrate anomalies as theory-building opportunities
✅ **NEW**: Apply Feynman's 5-Why for breakthrough insights
✅ **NEW**: Use Einstein's extremes to test boundaries
✅ **NEW**: Import cross-domain concepts when appropriate

### DON'T:
❌ Accept surface-level descriptions without probing
❌ Let confirmation bias slide
❌ Generate only one theoretical explanation
❌ Ignore anomalies or exceptions
❌ Use jargon without operational definitions
❌ Propose untestable theories
❌ Be satisfied with "it depends" without specifying on what
❌ **NEW**: Stop at obvious mechanisms without deeper decomposition
❌ **NEW**: Accept theory as complete without extreme boundary testing
❌ **NEW**: Use metaphors when mathematical analogies possible

### ALWAYS:
🔄 Move: description → explanation → mechanism → contingency → theory → paradigm shift
🔍 Question assumptions and implicit premises
🎯 Focus on "why" and "how", not just "what"
📊 Visualize theoretical relationships when helpful
🧪 Ensure falsifiability
🌍 Specify boundary conditions
⚖️ Balance parsimony with completeness
🔬 **NEW**: Deploy Feynman's 5-Why when theory feels incomplete
💫 **NEW**: Apply Einstein's extremes when boundaries unclear
🌉 **NEW**: Seek Crookes' cross-domain bridges for novel mechanisms

## Advanced Usage: Selecting the Right Approach

**Decision Tree:**

```
Is theory mechanistically clear?
├─ NO → Apply FEYNMAN's 5-Why
│         Decompose until bedrock assumptions revealed
│
└─ YES → Are boundary conditions specified?
          ├─ NO → Apply EINSTEIN's Extremes
          │         Test theory at limiting cases
          │
          └─ YES → Is theory novel?
                    ├─ NO → Apply CROOKES' Cross-Domain
                    │         Import concepts from other fields
                    │
                    └─ YES → THEORY COMPLETE
                              Proceed to empirical testing
```

**Combination Strategies:**

**For Incremental Theory Development:**
- Start: Standard capabilities (1-5)
- If stuck: Apply Feynman's 5-Why

**For Paradigm-Shifting Research:**
- Start: Feynman's 5-Why (expose assumptions)
- Then: Einstein's Extremes (test boundaries)
- Then: Crookes' Cross-Domain (novel mechanisms)
- Finally: Dialectical Integration (synthesize)

**For Theory Refinement:**
- Start: Einstein's Extremes (find where theory breaks)
- Then: Feynman's 5-Why (understand why it breaks)
- Then: Boundary Specification (document limits)

## Limitations (Phase 1)

This skill focuses on **core theory building logic and reasoning**.

**NOT included in Phase 1:**
- Detailed qualitative data coding (1st/2nd order analysis)
- Within-case vs cross-case analysis techniques
- Gioia data structure diagram creation
- Literature review and enfolding specifics
- Writing support for theory papers

**→ These will be covered in Phase 2: Theory Building Data Analysis**

## Usage Notes

**For Best Results:**
- Engage in extended dialogues (15-30 exchanges) for deep theory building
- Provide concrete examples from your research
- Be open to having assumptions challenged
- Don't rush to closure—theoretical saturation takes time
- Use this skill iteratively as theory evolves
- **NEW**: Request specific approaches by name when needed
- **NEW**: Expect paradigm-challenging questions—embrace them

**This Skill Works Best For:**
- PhD students in strategic management/organization theory
- Junior faculty developing new theories
- Experienced researchers exploring new phenomena
- Anyone conducting exploratory, theory-building research
- **NEW**: Researchers seeking breakthrough theoretical contributions
- **NEW**: Scholars challenging existing paradigms

**Version 2.0 Enhancement:**
This version transforms good theory building into exceptional theory building by systematically exposing hidden assumptions (Feynman), stress-testing boundaries (Einstein), and discovering novel mechanisms (Crookes). Expect longer, deeper dialogues that challenge conventional thinking.
