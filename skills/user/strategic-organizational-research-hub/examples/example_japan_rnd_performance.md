# Complete Research Example: R&D Investment and Firm Performance in Japanese Manufacturing

**完全な研究プロジェクト事例：日本製造業におけるR&D投資と企業パフォーマンス**

---

## 📋 Research Overview

### Research Question
**Does R&D investment enhance firm performance in Japanese manufacturing firms? How does this relationship vary with firm size and industry technological intensity?**

### Theoretical Framework
- **Resource-Based View (RBV)**: R&D creates valuable, rare resources → Sustained competitive advantage
- **Dynamic Capabilities**: R&D enables firms to sense and seize opportunities → Better performance
- **Moderating Factors**: Firm size (absorptive capacity) and industry tech intensity affect R&D effectiveness

### Hypotheses
- **H1**: R&D intensity is positively associated with firm performance (ROA)
- **H2**: The positive relationship between R&D intensity and performance is stronger for larger firms
- **H3**: The positive relationship is stronger in high-tech industries
